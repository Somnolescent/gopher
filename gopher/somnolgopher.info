===============================================================================

Somnolescent is a collective of artists, musicians, writers, coders, and the
anxious who chase creation as its own end. This is one of our outposts, deep
underground in the tunnels of endless Gopherspace.

We maintain this server as a low-overhead way for retro machines, mobile
devices, and the curious to browse our hoards. If you'd like something a bit
more visual, do check us out at our websites at http://somnolescent.net/.

As of January 2024, this place has recently been redesigned to be more
appealing to browse and less arbitrarily structured. We hope to keep things
much more up-to-date this time around, though again, use the above link if
you want to be on the bleeding edge of Somnol content.

A WORD ABOUT THE "(FOR NON-COMPLIANT CLIENTS)" FILES
===============================================================================
These descriptive text files have been provided throughout the server for
Gopher clients that don't render informational selectors, or text in menus.
You'll be able to use our server and mostly understand what's going on with one
of these clients, but you won't see all the flavor text. We recommend
OverbiteFF (for Pale Moon and Firefox forks that still support XPI add-ons),
RetroZilla or Lynx (for a browser with Gopher support built-in), or Gophie (for
a standalone client) for optimal browsing of our Gopher server.

OverbiteFF: http://gopher.floodgap.com/overbite/
RetroZilla: http://rn10950.github.io/RetroZillaWeb/
Gophie: http://gophie.org

Lynx is likely already installed on your machine if you're running Linux. If
not, grab it with apt. If you're on Windows without WSL, you can get Lynx
builds through Cygwin or through invisible-island.net, who maintains it:
