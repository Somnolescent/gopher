One part sperg, two parts call to arms.

I watch a lot of Oddity Archive. New episodes, old episodes, doesn't much
matter. Sometimes, what Benny-Boy touches on is something I already had an
interest in, and the episode on the analog TV shutdown is definitely that.
It's not one of my favorite episodes, but I was around for the shutdown when
I was little and it's stuck with me ever since, so occasionally, I watch it
again.

At the time, I just found TV via antenna a fascinating, glitchy, and novel
way to get your TV (we always had cable), and I guess as time goes on and my
values shape up as a person, I get to thinking of the more moral and
certainly logistical side of entire countries dumping their technology into
the ocean for The Future.

So as a brief overview if you're not American (though most of the world's
done this by now)--traditionally, over-the-air TV (antenna TV?) was broadcast
totally in analog. There's no computer involved in an old CRT, least not in
displaying the picture. It's really a marvel of electromechanical
engineering. In the late 90s, one of our many unnecessary government bureaus
mandated the eventual switch to totally digital broadcasting. Digital
promised to provide all these technical benefits, as does every invention
from The Future--we'll have more channels, they'll look better, first
responders will get to use those old TV frequencies instead, it'll be great.
The switchover finally happened in 2009.

In reality, the switchover was delayed several times over a period of four
years because no one was ready, people lost channels due to digital signals
not propagating as far, broadcasters now have to hit the transmitter with far
more power to reach the same area, broadcasters had to ask to be reallocated
across the UHF knob because of digital interference, digital only looked
good provided you had a clear picture (otherwise you have no picture, it's
all-or-nothing), and the now-unused UHF and VHF bands were instead auctioned
off in five blocks, four of which went to phone companies for 3G and LTE use.
Potentially, two entire bands which could've now gone to hobbyists, community
organizations, and low-power broadcasters have instead been used to generate
more money for a few telecoms. A massive e-waste issue has also been created
as without special equipment, the vast majority of CRTs are now functionally
useless. Mobile TVs used for campers and boaters are also now utterly useless
as they can't even take a converter box, and even if they can receive ATSC
signals, the total lack of stable reception makes them useless anyway.

In short, it cost a lot of money for no real gain. Here's a few comments
underneath that Oddity Archive video for extra context on how worthless this
switchover really was:

Analog TV is just a casualty of all this to me, despite my continued interest
in seeing those bands opened up to people like me to experiment with and for
communities and neighborhoods to come together over. The bigger issue is our
continued insistence on throwing perfectly functional shit away. Computers
see this constantly; given care and maintenance, a computer from 20 years ago
can still find plenty of use present-day. If we're talking newer, the
difference between new and used becomes almost irrelevant. Computers from ten
years ago can still handle the average person's workflow without issue. Yet,
you always seem due for an upgrade, according to the marketing people. Hell,
some people are trying to sell us on a totally smartphone-only future where
all desktops are obsolete, and *that's* some dystopian bullshit right there.

We like to make things "better" not because they actually get better, but
because we can. We try to throw technology at our problems, not realizing
those problems have been caused by our mindsets and the arbitrary way we've
decided to do things and not the technology. There's no better example of
this than with SSL/TLS, which I've talked about on the Scratchpad before. The
internet is a fundamentally trackable series of tubes that should not have
ever, even remotely, been trusted for anything that needs to be secure. Yet,
because we're just so allured with the concept of buying shit online or
banking online, we're entering an age where you need a new computer every few
years or so, despite your old one still working, because it's been deemed
"insecure" and "dangerous".

Somehow, I don't feel any safer with HTTPS, with all the security breaches in
the world happening 2-3 times a year. Anyone remember Equifax? People are now
actively encouraged to put their full dox online for anyone to see and to
send their bank information and identity through the magical pixie box, and
our solution for the inevitable issue of leaks, breaches, "stalking and
harassment", and identity theft is to use a Let's Encrypt certificate. I've
legitimately heard people trying to send Gopher data over TLS. It's
*useless*, and it just generates more goddamn e-waste, mandating an upgrade
because of another arbitrary stumbling block we tell ourselves is making our
infrastructure stronger.

How many millions of computers do you think are now decommissioned because we
just decided they weren't good enough? How many transmitters and linear video
editing systems are now sitting in the basement of TV studios across the US
alone because we just had to watch a sharper picture for no real benefit? It
makes me so damn happy every time I see one of these machines gain a second
life as a server or as a project box or as someone's actual work machine.
Hell, I'm doing my part with the eMachines box. It's not glamorous, LGR's
not doing a video on this computer, but goddamn if it doesn't make me fuzzy
using it.

This? *This* is why Somnolescent exists. Somnolescent isn't built on warm
fuzzy nostalgia for animated GIFs and star backgrounds and "gosh, wasn't
Geocities just *the best?*" *No.* It's about proving that the past very much
has a place in the future. In some cases, the past is far more useful than
the future. We're not into Gopher because it's a neat, *retro* thing to have
around. We're into it because we believe it has a use and function in the
modern day. Same with IRC, same with curated art portals, same with old
computers, and yeah, same with radio and analog TV. The modern internet
hasn't obsoleted them; they all have traits that make them worth the possible
*very slight* inconvenience of not having inline images.

Fuck, even Discord, a service I once passionately defended, has proven itself
genuinely incapable of being trusted after years of quietly upselling us on
microtransactions for features MSN Messenger had in 2008 and propagandizing
to us in the past month. The proof's in the pudding, really; you can't trace
a conversation in person without a microphone, and you can't trace a
shortwave broadcast without human error. You kids think you're gonna solve
tracking with Mastodon and the blockchain, once again throwing technology at
a mindset problem. Problem exists between keyboard and chair, admit it.

Technology augments humans; it's not meant to replace humans. Human nature is
the best thing to ever happen to this planet, everyone else is just too
blackpilled to see it. Fact is, some 25 years ago, we hit the peak of
technological innovation, and it's all been diminishing returns and
occasionally detrimental ever since. We have people trying to live entirely
on the internet, willingly and actively, and they're all buttfuck insane as a
result. Schools actively trying to make the upcoming school year digital-only
for fear of the coof. None of this is sustainable. Technology cannot replace
our humanity, no matter what they push us towards.

Minimize, reduce, and reconnect. See the beauty in what everyone else
considers outdated. Be self-sufficient. Laugh at those who hitched their
wagons to Twitter. It's an all-around better existence.
