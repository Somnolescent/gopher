# I'm Still Fundamentally Disappointed in Gopher's Userbase

I'm sure there's good stuff to see, right? Right?

Hello from the eMachines Box, lads. Been hiding out off Discord, binge-
reading a lot of the Internet Underground archives, wrote a bit last night,
has been good.

I don't have a powerful enough browser on here to make direct WordPress
posting work, and while I've wanted to post via email for a while now, I
learned that WordPress' built-in email posting is actually deprecated, so I
needed a plugin to make that work. But she does work now! I'm gonna keep
playing with formatting and things, but really, my goal is to make my posts
here a little simpler, like what the Scratchpad started as.

I've been back on Gopher a bunch too. My main driver is RetroZilla, which is
excellent for simple web and Gopher stuff in a single application. It also
hums along quite nicely with 512MB of RAM, which the last XP version of
Firefox often doesn't, so it's a no brainer browser.

Part of the thing that makes the old web fun is how varied the content can
be. A lot of it was written by people who had nothing more than FrontPage to
work with, and they made the most of it. I've found everything on Wiby. Just
now, I hit the Surprise button and ended up at a site about simple
boatbuilding. I'm a boy who likes water. This intrigues me.

Gopher is, unfortunately, forever the opposite. It's opaque to normal people,
yet it's the perfect toy for tech people who have (and I'm trying to be nice
here) a personality deficit. They've got their server set up with a BSD of
some flavor, and perhaps the Gopher is one they wrote themselves (always in a
trendy language like Go, of course). Naturally, one of their selectors will
be for server temps and uptime. You can expect their top-level menu to have
lots of ASCII art, because ASCII art bleeds cool.

And then you hit that dead end. A fuck off toy here (I saw someone make an
ASCII art maze on Gopher, where the selectors let you navigate it), a random
generator you play with for all of 15 seconds there, and then you're stuffed.
Phlogs are huge in Gopherspaceâ€“and they're never worth the two minutes I
spend scanning through them. One guy had a post about how he set up his home
server so he could SSH into it from his hometown across the country, and
then it didn't connect to his router over wi-fi properly, so he couldn't
connect in!

What a story Mark.

Fun game. Go find any tilde with Gopher access. (The one I tried this with
at least had the decency to only show folks who had updated their home
gophermap.) About 20% of them were the default gophermap anyway, just with
one or two words changed, because quirky. 30% were blank altogether, usually
admitting they had zero use for the fucking thing. 5% were basically just
pages advertising their owner's Gemini server (I'm still not reading it,
losers). The other 45% had phlogs, and shock of shocks, were the same phlogs
everyone else had. (Cliffnotes of one I just found, courtesy of a Mastodon
user of course: some links. "Didn't do much today." "Didn't do much today.".
More links. "Didn't get much done, but I toyed with Android.")

I've never seen a more stark landscape of computer nerds with zero reason to
exist. I see it surprisingly often in MiloHax, which overlaps the computer
nerd crowd, the retrogaming crowd, and the Twitch crowd. They're nearly
always lurkers (you wouldn't lurk if you had a reason to be there, after
all), when they do pop up, they usually have a rather blatantly insecure
sense of humor, they ask very dumb, answered-many-times-before questions,
and sometimes, you get one that tells you very loudly how mean your community
is before they storm off and everyone forgets their name immediately.

I think the way the modern, social internet is built encourages people to
only pursue "acceptable" interests, which in techie scenes, means
technology. If any art is involved, it's nearly always music, and always the
same kinds of generic techno/chiptune/tracker stuff every last one of them
pretend to be really into. On the rare occasion I do find a Gopher with some
nice photography or a cool premise, I'll bookmark it, but man, that folder
is a bit bare right now.

We were so spoiled on Neocities.
