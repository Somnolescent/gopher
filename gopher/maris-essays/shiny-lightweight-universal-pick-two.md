When in doubt, make it in Flash, apparently.

Mini-rant today, this one in response to another longform piece from
Neocities user elaboraet. It's ostensibly a rant about the ever-increasing
weight of websites and how "all modern design looks the same". Kind of a
muddled mess, but I vaguely agree with its point. Sites are bloated, and a
lot of them probably look a little too cloney for comfort.

At the same time, some of its proposed solutions are pretty amusing, and it
definitely reeks of roses and nostalgia. Take, for instance, the way it
glamorizes Flash websites.

Listen, I know we all love to glamorize the past, but Flash websites were
absolute shit. Flash died because it was a security hazard and web standards
grew to the point where we could implement all of the animation and media
content that Flash enabled in-browser rather than using a plugin. This is a
*good* thing. Flash websites were the Bootstrap sites of their time; they
might not have been heavy, but they weren't user-friendly, machine-readable,
or accessible. Flash content was not responsive; if you had a big monitor,
that site would still be 640x480.

Why you'd ever hold up a Flash site as being a high point of web design,
I have no fucking clue.

I also don't quite understand why people have an issue with phones being the
dominant way people access media. It sounds like some old person "back in my
day" shit, as if having a super powerful, super portable device to access
any content you fancy at any time is something to bemoan. Phones have made
internet access ubiquitous, globally (not that I especially agree with
globalism), and while they haven't replaced my desktop, I use mine every day
and I've made sure my site works well on it.

Every time I see a woke computer kid describe their site as "not mobile
friendly", I get a tiny bit annoyed. It's pure laziness. Media queries allow
you to have a functional, lightweight site on both desktop and mobile, and
these people can't be assed to test on other browsers, let alone test on
other devices. Why even bother pretending you have some passion for web
design if you're gonna tell a varying amount of your potential audience to
piss in a wall outlet?

The other solution the essay seems to propose is...no styling whatsoever.

It's a total rejection of all the wonderful things the web has brought us to
say there's no way to have a usable, informative site without going full
1994. Both the NPR site and the CNN site are dreadfully boring to look at and
annoying to read; the text takes up the full fucking width of the viewport.
There's barely a margin. The solution to sites being heavy and samey is not
to make them vanilla and samey. Layouts are not the enemy.

We, for the first time in web history, we have the ability to make a shiny,
lightweight site that works everywhere. Why elaboraet is keen on picking two
and only two, I don't know.
