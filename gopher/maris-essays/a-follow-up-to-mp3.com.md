# A Follow-Up to MP3.com
## February 2, 2020

Some things I left out of the original post and checking in on some old users.

---

Mid-last month, I wrote about the death of a very old site called MP3.com. I
got most of what I wanted to say out in that post, but at the time, there was
still a lot I didn't know about the service and some of its lesser
functionality. I figure a follow-up is in order, and I'd also like to write a
bit about some of the artists I showcased in that post to give you a better
idea of the kind of people who you'd find on there.

## DAM (Digital Automatic Music) Discs

MP3.com would let bands sell their material as on-demand CD-Rs called
"digital automatic music" discs. From what I can gather, the earliest DAM
discs dropped in 1999 or so and all used very generic packaging, with most of
the "artwork" consisting of the MP3.com logo. Later discs allowed for at
least a custom front cover, though the back and inlay were always a standard
MP3.com template with basic Arial text.

These discs were mixed mode CDs that contained the MP3s of the album in
question (of course), a self-contained Flash MP3 player (yes, Macromedia
Flash!), and, most amusingly, the same 128kbps MP3s burned as CDDA. So yes,
while they'd play in a normal CD player, they would sound identical to the
streaming "hi-fi" copy. That is, not very good. I can't tell if this was
someone simply jabbing or what, but an old Slashdot thread makes reference to
the Xing MP3 encoder in relation to these discs.

I think this goes to show you just how ragtag MP3.com could be. People in
their garages, with no audio engineering background to speak of, were
putting shit online, as were industry veterans and everything in between. It
was a hell of a crowd.

If you're wondering, Discogs has about the most complete (but still not
otally complete) selection of DAM discs I've been able to find. I don't think
we'll ever know the full extent of what was available on the service, but at
least we have a line on some of the discs themselves. I think they're neat as
a historical curiosity on their own, let alone if the music's any good.

And, as a final point of note, MP3.com also let the bands just plain sell
their own discs through the service. This is why, say, AFI's "Totalimmortal"
single released through MP3.com doesn't follow this formula (though this was
also likely a promotional thing, seeing as the band had buzz and a label
behind them anyway).

## Checking in on MP3.com's old users
[This section will make no sense without the context that these essays are
ported from my very-active WordPress blog at mariteaux.somnolescent.net/blog/
which naturally has images inlined into the post. I used these artist's
profiles to demonstrate what MP3.com looked like across time. Back to the
original text.]

As I got to digging, I got curious as to what else I could find for the
artists whose pages I ended up using on the original MP3.com post. I used
these specific pages as the Wayback Machine often didn't catch all of the
page assets (and indeed, I had to be a little cheeky with the
otherwise-intact PPK page because one of the bits of album art didn't get
saved either).

Regardless, I like to think I got a pretty decent collection of at least the
more indie side of MP3.com. Some of these artists have pretty studied and
fascinating histories on their own, so allow me to summarize and you can
sample their work.

### PPK
PPK was a Russian trance duo who were something of stars of MP3.com. From
what I can gather, their 2001 song "ResuRection" was actually kind of a hit,
being the first charting single ever from a Russian group on the UK Singles
Chart (at #3) and going Silver for it. They also peaked at #26 on the
Billboard Dance Club Songs chart over here. Hell, even the YouTube upload
has 1.2mi views.

PPK petered out after the release of *Reload*, releasing a few more remixes
throughout the 2000s and finally breaking up after a short domestic tour in
2010-2011. Still, not a bad showing for being totally indie.

### Susan Greenbaum
She looks like a total mom on her artist page (and "adult contemporary",
read: momcore, doesn't help), and that's why I was curious. Susan's a singer-
songwriter from Virginia who apparently used to be a boardroom brawler at
"Fortune 500 companies" (which ones, we're not quite sure) before she went to
play music instead. Not my usual thing, but she's got a nice voice. I might
just like female singers though.

Turns out, Susan Greenbaum is still around, at least according to her website
(and yes, you can still buy *Hey Hey Hey!* after all these years), and the
latest performance of hers I care to find was about two years ago.
Apparently, she played at a show with Jason Mraz, who's a name I've actually
heard of, so go figure.

### Acoustic Rescue
Amusingly enough, this one comes from South Wales, like everything in my life
these days uwu. This is the group I was able to find the least about, but my
searches weren't totally fruitless. Seems this was an acoustic folk duo
active in the very early 2000s made up of (and no, it's not the ones you're
thinking of) brothers Ray and Spencer Davies. They're not related to the
Acoustic Rescue Unit or the Acoustic Rescue Group, who make up the searches
if you go looking now.

Thankfully, while their MP3.com stuff is gone, the Internet Underground Music
Archive kept a copy of some of their work, in case you'd like to sample their
fingerpicking prowess. Track 05 ("Driftwood Sign") also has vocals, if you're
into that. And for no reason at all other than secondary sources, here's an
article that mentioned them playing live at Burnley Mechanics almost 18 years
ago to this day. Gotta love old news.

### Ben Minnotte
What? I couldn't just neglect the reason I looked into this in the first
place.

Ben Minnotte started making so-called "music" in mid-2001 using only a few
cheap guitars, a tape recorder, and Windows' Sound Recorder, and later
upgrading to an incredibly high-end Fostex X-14 multitracker. Typical of the
bedroom strummers of the time, Ben's deaf off-kilter Johnston-meets-Shaggs
Jackson Browne impressions didn't go too far, but what he's released of it
since then, I find rather charming. Whether or not he genuinely sold his soul
to the man in his hole is up to interpretation.

Ben went on to record a few more musically-ept albums, namely 2006's
*Greetings From Elderbush Gulch* and 2010's *Minn-Knot*, capping off with a
few live performances around the Denver area before giving up the music thing
altogether. Ben now runs a cult YouTube channel dedicated to bizarre tech and
local TV refuse called the Oddity Archive and has featured his music semi-
egularly on the show in incidental form. (Ben's Music "Career" Vol. 4 is set
to drop in March, according to the man himself. Fuckin' hype.)

### Skylab2000
I've *definitely* saved the most interesting artist for last. It didn't make
much of a difference to me when I was putting the original article together,
but as it turns out, Skylab2000 was actually a rather influential rave
outfit, and its main man, the unfortunately now-deceased Dennis Barton, was
something of a mad scientist.

Barton was raised in L.A.'s punk and post-punk scenes, working sound for
venues where acts like the Minutemen, Husker Du, and X played. By 1991, the
rave scene had started to take hold in the underground, and Barton, who was
already something of a technical wizard, paired up with the new kid on the
block, one Stuart Breidenstein, to play their own blend of intense-yet-
trancey rave music.

> Dennis' attraction to electronic music was natural and inexorable. As a
> little boy, he had a soldering iron and Radio Shack kits. He would take
> appliances apart and put them back together. He was fascinated by machines.
> It seemed he loved them because he understood them.
> 
> "He could buy a piece of shit car and he could make it run," says Peter.
> "He had such an agile, inquiring mind. He built crystal radios and potato
> batteries. Everything was a puzzle that could be solved."

Skylab2000 (named for the NASA satellite that fell out of the sky) would pop
up in 1992 and set themselves apart by playing all of their music live,
sometimes being the only proper live act on a bill of entirely DJs. From
their first big show to long past the "Rollergirl" single, Skylab2000 burned
through the SoCal rave scene in a flurry of jittery 303 basslines, Juno-106
sweeps, and ancient MS-DOS sequencers. At times, they played to 40,000
Turkish festivalgoers in one trip.

Skylab mostly retired in 2011 and Barton took up electrical engineering
instead, where he spent his twilight years building gadgets and entertaining
those he kept company with with his quiet wit and technical know-how. Barton
died on February 4, 2017, and the world lost a mastermind. It's a long read,
but if you're into electronica, this Medium article paints a really detailed
picture of the man and I highly recommend it.

I'm still immensely fascinated by MP3.com. The fact that this site got as big
as it did and then died as quickly as it lived and isn't more fondly
remembered astounds me. It was as if for a brief moment, music fulfilled its
promise. Even if 99% of it was terrible, what the internet promised to do for
music, it accomplished on all fronts. I might've had a different opinion if I
were around to see it, but given the eulogizing in scattered comments, I
don't think so.

To date, nothing has quite replicated what MP3.com had. Bandcamp might have
the uploads, but it doesn't have the forums or the charts. Soundcloud and
Spotify might take a more social focus, but that only goes so far in the
landfill of the algorithm. MP3.com truly was something special. I'm glad a
good few who were on there kept going after the site shut down.

For now, I'll just go back to being a bedroom strummer myself, occasionally
making bleepy-bloopy crispy-crunchy music and maybe getting it out there one
day. Whatever I'm up to, though, I hope to keep the spirit of MP3.com alive.
