==== THE GRAND SOMNOLESCENT PLAYLIST ==================================
0About the Grand Somnolescent Playlist (for non-compliant clients)	music.info

At various points in time, the Somnolians have played around with the
idea of making music. There's a lot more to be mined there, but for
now, because Gopherspace doesn't have enough computer music bangers
for download, we offer what we have.

Each submenu is devoted to an album each from a member of the group.
Downloads for all tracks are featured in 11KHz 8-bit WAVs for retro
machines and a ZIP of 128kbps MP3s for download. If you'd like higher
quality formats, including lossless formats, do follow the Bandcamp
links in each submenu and give us money. We like money.
