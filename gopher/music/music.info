===============================================================================

At various points in time, the Somnolians have played around with the idea of
making music. There's a lot more to be mined there, but for now, because
Gopherspace doesn't have enough computer music bangers for download, we offer
what we have.

Each submenu is devoted to an album each from a member of the group. Downloads
for all tracks are featured in 11KHz 8-bit WAVs for retro machines and a ZIP
of 128kbps MP3s for download. If you'd like higher quality formats, including
lossless formats, do follow the Bandcamp links in each submenu and give us
money. We like money.
