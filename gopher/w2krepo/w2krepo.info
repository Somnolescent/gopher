PROJECT: w2krepo on Gopher
MAINTAINER: dotcomboom (dotcomboom@somnolescent.net)

w2krepo is a software repository serving roughly the 1998-2004 time period.
While it takes its name from Windows 2000 (and many of its programs are
picked specifically to run under it), that's not all it caters to--Palm,
PocketPC, and Windows Mobile software also feature. All downloads are either
freeware, shareware, demos of commercial software, or abandonware.

This Gopher edition of w2krepo is offered for ease of browsing on older
machines with Gopher clients. As Gopher doesn't protect against abrupt
disruptions in the download stream, files over 50mb are not offered over it.
Instead, links to the software in question on the HTTP version of w2krepo are
offered on their respective menus. These should work on any PC with a
functioning web browser.

Any feedback, questions, or donations of software sent to the above email
address are greatly appreciated.
