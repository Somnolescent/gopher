==== W2KREPO ON GOPHER ================================================
0About w2krepo on Gopher (for non-compliant clients)	w2krepo.info

w2krepo is a software repository serving roughly the 1998-2004 time
period. While it takes its name from Windows 2000 (and many of its
programs are picked specifically to run under it), that's not all it
caters to--Palm, PocketPC, and Windows Mobile software also feature.
All downloads are either freeware, shareware, demos of commercial
software, or abandonware.

This Gopher edition of w2krepo is offered for ease of browsing on older
machines with Gopher clients. As Gopher doesn't protect against abrupt
disruptions in the download stream, files over 50MB are not offered
over it. Instead, links to the software in question on the HTTP version
of w2krepo are offered on their respective menus. These should work on
any PC with a functioning web browser.

Any feedback, questions, or donations of software sent to the
submission center are greatly appreciated.
