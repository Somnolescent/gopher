# Colton's Bio
### From gopher.somnolescent.net, the Gopherhole of the weird lightbulb people
- NAME: Colton
- SEX: Male
- SPECIES: Raccoon
- AGE: 15
- WORLD: Pennyverse (https://toyhou.se/~world/30445.pennyverse)

## Background
It's not that Colton had a bad upbringing, just a...frequently abandoned one.
He was the only son of a night creature single mother with only a tiny
apartment in The City between them. They called her Sammy, and without many
friends or much money, she did her best to keep Colton taken care of. Between
napping next to her on the long days when she worked nights and watching way
too much public access (and catching many of The City's burgeoning indie
bands in the process), Colton was happily oblivious to the cold, uncaring
City around him.

Sammy stopped coming home one September evening, about three months before
the start of the main storyline. Colton sat staring out the front apartment
window until 4AM that night, but to no avail. A rather untrusting, isolated
girl, Sammy left behind a bit of money under her mattress that Colton was
able to leave on the windowsill for rent or to get pizza with, but really, he
wanted his mother back. Still with the wounds fresh, a month later, Colton
met Penny, herself M.I.A. from her friends. Though kind and motherly enough
to him, Penny ultimately returned with Sebastian and Kevin after they
recovered her.

Colton, aching from the loss of both, declared himself independent at 14 and
grew withdrawn. Still, Sammy's mattress money would only last so long, and
knowing the trio had moved to Apricot Bay thanks to a passing comment from
Kevin, took what would've been the last rent payment and paid for a train
ticket instead. It's not that he wanted to see Penny again, though that
would've been really nice...it just seemed like a safer place to stay than
The City.

## Description
### Appearance/grooming habits
He doesn't intend to look dirty or anything, but only having one jacket means
you kinda live in that one jacket, especially when it's a comfy, protective
thing like it is for him. Madeleine's parents help majorly in that respect,
getting him some new clothes when he starts to outgrow his old, tattered City
ones. Neutral colored, loose casual wear is what Colton prefers, especially
out on his walks, though at her father's insistence, he's absolutely got a
tuxedo on standby.

### Voice/speech patterns
Colton always sounds a tiny bit lost when he talks, many pauses and filler
words, though they filter out when he's excited, passionate, or there's
something specific on his mind. There's a certain thin tone to his voice
(I've always thought of a less nasal, younger Elliott Smith) that especially
comes out when he's singing. Such is life when you're untrained, but he
makes it work.

### Tics/nervous habits
Lots of handwringing and grabbing at things. How much of that is due to
autism and how much of that is just being a raccoon is up for interpretation.
Still, there's a reason you'll find him sitting with a guitar even when he's
not playing. Security blanket and good chord practice too.

## Personality
### Strengths
Colton's a brave, independent, protective fellow. When he starts to heal
some, you'll find a raccoon lad eager to help people where he can, never
backing down when things look rough, and--though he's far too humble to admit
it--happy to entertain with his guitar. When it comes to music, his or
others', expect a ton of rambling about guitars, amps, studios, and mixes.

### Weaknesses
That stubborn independence also works against Colton at times. He's not
necessarily avoidant of people, but at the start of the story, he considers
his frequent patronage of the Art Gallery *his* choice and no one else's.
When he's emotional, be that anger and fury or achy sadness, it tends to come
down rather hard.

### Hobbies
Music! All those years spent watching bands and singer-songwriters on TV
stuck with him, and when his mentor Riley gave him his ancient acoustic from
years back, Colton was all over it. Past that, Colton's usually around
climbing trees (scaring Riley in the process) or holding his Madeleine's hand
on walks through the wooded hills of the Valley Cascadia.

### Fears/insecurities
Colton's got some trust issues to work out, especially early on. You don't
lose your entire world twice without developing them, blaming yourself,
blaming the world, all that. He's got a bit of a complex at times about
essentially being a dirty stray, something Madeleine's parents sadly
contribute to at first and ultimately help rectify when they take him in as
one of their own.

### Disorders/diseases
Colton's somewhere on the autism spectrum, certainly. He can devour a stack
of biographies (good for his slightly lacking reading ability...) and tab
books and excitedly tell you about every last page. He's also incredibly
picky about the feel of his instruments--their weight on his shoulders (heavy
please), the roughness of their strings on his fingers (heavy gauge and
rough please), and so forth.
