# Kevin's Nachos

Kevin goes looking for snacks and adventure in another dimension.

## 1. Spatial Disorientation
It was something he couldn't explain to Seb, let alone show him. A fuzzy
portal across a fuzzy expanse, where things exist until they don't and don't
exist until they do. A field of chaos, where the air melts, turns liquid,
solid, and then back again in mere moments. An eternity of noise, a friend to
those who could bear it, a void of tinnitus weighing down on those caught
inside. Kevin liked it mostly for its nachos, though.

He found it behind a book on glass-blowing: a fizzling, squishy spot in the
old wooden supports behind the library shelf. Kevin grabbed it in his meaty
paw and ripped to the side, throwing the void wide open. The edge of
existence glowed slightly, and globules of shimmering, iridescent light
leaked out of it into the open air. Kevin's eyes widened, and a low
"ooooh..." emanated from his throat.

Trying to fit his oversized frame between the shelves, the aardwolf carefully
climbed the hole into the bleed zone.

Kevin drifted softly downwards. Gravity seemed intermittent on the other
side, but he made it back to rocky ground without injury. Bands of bright
blues and whites flickered and faded over the void of the sky, a bit like
the fuzziness you get when you close your eyes and push down on them. Kevin
was grinning rather wide now; the bleed zone was once home for him.

Making a careful leap across the endless expanse, he latched onto the side
of a floating island. His exposed fur bristled and spatial disorientation
soon had him in his clutches. Such were the effects of a bleed zone on a
sapient.

One leap lead to another, and off Kevin went into the abyss, looking for
nachos.

## 2. Night Falls on the Unsuspecting
"Hey, Miguel! Hurry up!"

"Awright, I'm coming, I'm coming!"

Marcela clung impatiently to the shoulder of Rocco's tunic as she watched the
capybara lumber casually up the hill. He'd stopped towards the bottom to
adjust the rawhide quiver around his waist, and frankly, he wasn't exactly
the quickest of the three to begin with.

Rocco fidgeted with the contents of the satchel over his other shoulder.
"Remind me to never buy anything in Dragonbridge again." *Waterskins, jerky,
berries, potions, dagger, map...*

Miguel, at long last, made it to the top, slightly out of breath.

"Took ya long enough," Marcela mumbled.

"I made it up here, Marcy, calm down. Where are we off to now?"

Rocco unrolled the paper map from off its dowel rod and scanned it over.
"Hm, southeast, I reckon. Should--be a path that gets us back on the main
road."

It wasn't twenty paces away that a flash of light hit Miguel's peripheral
vision. He turned to face it, and Rocco and Marcela turned in kind. Kevin
stood at the bottom of a hill with a small paper bowl of nachos covered in
cheese and sour cream in his hand.

Munching away at a chip, he waved at the party.

"Uh."

"Hello?"

"Hi, multiverse people!" Kevin took a break from his snack and stumbled up
the hill, not seeming to mind their confused glares.

Marcela squinted. "*Excuse* me?"

"Oh, you're an aardwolf too!" Kevin exclaimed. He stuck the bowl out at
Rocco. "Want one?"

"I am--good, thank you."

Kevin couldn't help but admire the scenery of the shimmering strait and
Dragonbridge in fog from atop the hill as he dug through the bowl with his
other hand. "Are you guys roleplaying?"

Miguel cocked his head. "Roleplaying?"

"Yeah! Like sometimes, Seb and Penny go over to that badger's house and they
pretend to be medieval people with spells and stuff."

"Where did you *come* from?" Marcela asked.

"The City!"

"...*Which* city?"

Kevin put a finger up to his mouth in thought.

"Dragonbridge?"

"No, The City."

"Yes, but which one?"

Marcela interjected again. "And what are you wearing?"

Kevin looked down at his clothes. "My jacket! It's comfy." How out of
place he looked among their leather armour, belted tunics, and bladed
weaponry didn't occur to him until it was pointed out. Still, he liked his
jacket more.

Still more than a little confused, Rocco backed away from Kevin. "Well..."
he started. "We--best get going. Night falls on the unsuspecting."

"Oh, can I come with you?"

Marcela shook her head. "No way."

Kevin whimpered. "Please? You won't even know I'm here, I promise!"

"Listen, big fella," Miguel said. "We've gotta be in Freyvale in a week.
If you're lost, I can point you back to Dragonbridge..."

"He can come," Rocco interjected. He was impatient; a fourth member of the
party wouldn't matter much, even one too busy eating strange nachos to be
of much use.

And so, Rocco and friends set off on the way back to the main road,
confused and uneasy.

Marcela climbed atop Rocco's shoulder and hissed in his ear, annoyed.
"What, is it because he's an aardwolf?"

## 3. Not Dangerous
About an hour out from sundown, and the party was stuck. Civilization was
nowhere nearby. No place to take refuge after the long day spent following
trails over wonky bridges, through grasslands, and listening to the strange,
oversized aardwolf talk about a "Seb" and "Penny" some more.

Miguel squinted. "Mmmh. We should've hit an inn by now."

"You have no idea where we are, do you?"

Rocco growled at the flying squirrel hanging off his shoulder. "I do, I do,
just--hold on." He yanked the map out of a side pocket of his satchel and
scanned it frantically.

"...I have no idea where we are."

"Well, what do we do now?"

Kevin gasped, pointing into the distance. "There's a cave over there!"

Miguel and Marcela looked at each other with pulled faces. Nonetheless,
options were few, and so, the weary trio set off for the relative safety of
it. It was a big, wide opening over some rocks that descended into a
space with an underground lake. It wasn't pretty--caves never are--but it
was shelter.

Marcela glided down to the water's surface, and Rocco climbed down the rock
facade after her, making sure things were stable and smooth for the others.
It wasn't that steep of a decline, just enough to hurt greatly if you lost
your balance.

"Um, guys..." Kevin said nervously. "It looks--dangerous..."

"It's not that far!" By the time he said it, Rocco's feet were back on solid
ground. Of course, he was also busy backing away from the wall in case Kevin
came tumbling. Miguel went next, and while capybaras weren't exactly known
for their climbing ability, he made it down without error.

Kevin was frozen, anxious. He was used to fire escapes and maybe forests, not
falling down craggy, fractured rock facades, and he wasn't exactly looking
forward to the experience. Still, he gave it the old college try nonetheless,
hugging the jagged stone as close as he could and only moving when he was
sure nothing would crumble under his weight.

Getting back to the ground was a religious experience; Kevin would've
preferred to never go through it again.

Most of the cave room was taken up by a huge underground lake, deep and
mostly still aside from some waves and bubbles down below. The others didn't
seem to mind it much, but Kevin kneeled close to the water's edge, trying
to see what was stirring. For the most part, it wasn't much, and the lack of
ambient lighting wasn't helping that, but then--something shifted.

"Whoa."

"What now?"

"Something's moving..."

Kevin leaned in closer, trying his best to see into the depths. Something
inky came at him. A turtle-like beast, a sandy red aside from its dark, giant
eyes and its slate-coloured, spiky shell, surfaced. Kevin only stared back
at it.

"Mate, get away from it!" Miguel shouted. Plucking an arrow from his quiver
with reflexes more fitting of a jaguar, he pulled it hard against his
bowstring and fired it right at the beast, missing its flesh narrowly in the
darkness. Rocco had his sabre pulled on instinct.

Kevin was unfazed. Despite Miguel's protests, he inched closer to it,
reaching out a hand with which to touch its shell. It swam closer to the
edge, over to Kevin before emerging from the water altogether and climbing
onto his lap.

Kevin grabbed a worm from a small patch of dirt nearby and held it out for
the turtle, who accepted it into its jaws.

"What the hell--"

Kevin smiled and held the side of the turtle's shell gently. "Guys, he's not
dangerous."
