The trio arrives in Apricot Bay and find strangeness around the edges.

"Kevin...Kevin, wake up. We're almost at the station."

Two days out from having left the din of The City. Two days spent train
hopping. Two days of the roll of evergreens punctuated by dark brick tunnels.
Two days of trying to get Penny to stop terrorizing the lady with the food
cart. (And two days of watching Kevin pick the food cart clean.)

It doesn't feel right to summarize it like that. It was two days alone with
my thoughts, which never seem to leave me alone. Two days felt more like two
months, but two months ago, I was bleeding out in an alleyway for sticking my
big, stupid nose where it didn't belong. Sometime between then and now, I
decided leaving it all behind was the better option.

Penny peeked out of the overhead baggage compartment with a set of keys on a
ring. "Seb, look what I got!"

"Uh, what are those?"

"Conductor's~"

I yelped and swiped the keyring from her paws, pulling her with them. She
tumbled out from above and landed on the seat opposite mine on all fours.

"Penny!" I snarled. "You'll get us in trouble!"

She giggled and climbed back up into the darkness.

Kevin stirred. Kevin, my long-suffering aardwolf friend--I moved for all our
sakes, but especially his. He'd been doggedly loyal, by my side every day
during the search for Penny, through all the uncertainty, the teasing, the
fits and stops. Somehow, even after I put him through the panic and misery
of almost getting myself killed, even after all those nights spent broken
down by my hospital bed--he still wanted to be my friend.

I don't deserve him, but I'm glad he's still with me.

"We're almost there?" He asked, yawning.

"Soon."

Wasn't long before his snout was pressed up against the glass again. "...Man,
I've never seen so many trees before..."

"Oh, you've never been out of The City, have you, Kevin? Here, if you like
trees--" I rummaged through the front pocket of my suitcase, pulled out the
brochure, and handed it to him "--you'll like where we're going."

"Apricot Bay?"

"Forests, waterfalls, beaches, warm year-round, and *apricots*. Barely a few
hundred people around. It's wonderful." ...Admittedly, I'd only seen
pictures before we started packing up and leaving, but--it sounded nice, I
think. 

"Ooooooooh...do you think the people are nice?"

"Yeah! Well, I mean--they should be. You know small town people, very--
friendly. Hospitable. Not like city people, that's for sure."

"Yeah...city people are mean. I want apricots now."

The train car rumbled under the force of the breaks. A tinny voice came over
the speakers. "Now arriving at: Apricot Bay."

Kevin squealed; I love seeing him that happy. As the train rolled into the
station, a cozy, blocky brick building that didn't look a thing like The
City's train station, we gathered our bags and stood in wait.

The oblivious heron conductor passed by our booth one last time, and I tried
my best not to give eye contact.

Penny stuck her tongue out at him.

Sigh.

My first steps off the train disoriented me. No city smog to breathe here,
no cracks in the sidewalks, not a sign of decay to be found. I could see
brightly colored houses and shops for what seemed like miles, their windows
curtained with flowers and their facades choked with ivy overgrow. The rocky
cliffs of the bay hung barely visible behind it all, on the other side of
town. The townspeople bounced a little. It was warm out, for the first
time in months; Kevin even took off his jacket, which I've never seen him do
before.

A hand-carved wood sign sat planted just outside the outer limits. "Apricot
Bay: Settled 1919," it said, and stylized white and deep purple apricot
blooms wrapped around the lettering. It was cheesy, but it was home now.

We passed through the town square on the way to the house, where the
flagstone gave way to an apricot tree towering in the center. Its branches
spidered out and stuck out sharply, and though it wouldn't bear fruit until
the fall, it seemed plenty on its way there. For shade, it was rather lousy
and thin, but for size? I've never seen a tree that big, and--

--Something about it nailed me to the ground. I felt like I'd suddenly
forgotten everything I should've known in that moment, and I never quite
realized how tiny and inconsequential I was until I saw myself beside it. I
froze anxiously, like I was on trial and its leaves decided my fate.

"Seb?"

Dread.

My gaze shot to Kevin, but I could barely focus my eyes on him. We stood
trading stares in silence for a moment.

Whatever it was, he didn't need to tell me twice. I walked a little faster
the rest of the way, fast enough for even Penny to trail me.

Thankfully, before long, we'd arrived at the house. I found us a little three
bedroom townhouse down one of the bay's cul-de-sacs, something close to the
north beach. I figured Kevin and Penny could go down there and play in the
waves when I was busy with work or something.

"Hey Seb, someone's at our mailbox!"

Wasn't much for talking right now, but I looked anyway. He was a fire fox
about my height, orange-and-white streaked coat (albeit less loud than
Penny's), bundled up in long pants and a turtleneck under his uniform, and
carrying a messenger bag absolutely stuffed with papers. His face lit up
when he saw us.

"Hello, hello! Are you the folks moving in today?"

Kevin, on the other hand, was more than happy to talk. "Yeah!"

"Well, welcome! Always nice to see fresh faces around here. Where are you
all from?"

"The City!"

"Golly, city folk? I could never live in The City, I always miss home too
much." He wrapped his bushy tail around his ankles and looked down. "Oh, how
rude of me, I forgot to introduce myself! I'm Arthur, your mailman. I'm on my
rounds right now."

"I'm Kevin, and these are my friends, Penny and Seb."

I couldn't listen to it. I left without a word.

Behind me, I heard the conversation continue.

"Oh dear...is he okay?"

"Seb gets grumpy sometimes."

"Yeah, he's a stinky," Penny chimed in.

I wandered inside, heading straight for the master bedroom I'd claimed for
myself, locked the door, drew the blinds, turned up the AC, unpacked my
computers, and basked in the bright blue glow of my screens once more.

The scenery wasn't about to stop me from business as usual.
