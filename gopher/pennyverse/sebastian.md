# Sebastian's Bio
### From gopher.somnolescent.net, the Gopherhole of the weird lightbulb people
- NAME: Sebastian (Seb for short)
- SEX: Male
- SPECIES: Nine-banded armadillo
- AGE: 26
- WORLD: Pennyverse (https://toyhou.se/~world/30445.pennyverse)

## Background
As nine-banded armadillos do, Sebastian was born in The City as a quadruplet
with three identical brothers: Montague (Monty), Theodore (Theo), and
Percival (Percy). His parents, though successful, were of the clueless,
pretentious, absentee variety, and it being The City, it's not as if
Sebastian had very many friends either. Thus, he retreated into the
unflinching embrace of the early internet and using their money to buy techy
things to play with. In short, a well-off, miserable, lonely childhood.

Sebastian ended up doing contract work for a server farm run by a cat named
Kyle, and this was how he got introduced to Kyle's niece, the perpetual thorn
in his side Penny. Kevin just showed up in the alleyway next to the facility
one day, despite aardwolves not being native to The City and Kevin having no
background, contacts, or concerns about much aside from tuna. Sebastian would
end up taking both of them in after Penny's episode, and despite his own lack
of desire to be there, moved to Apricot Bay with them for their safety and
comfort.

By the start of the story, Sebastian, Kevin, and Penny live in a townhouse at
the edge of town, a hill away from Apricot Bay's scenic beaches and sea
stacks—not that he has any interest in that. Fish go to the bathroom in that
water, don't you know?

## Description
### Appearance/grooming habits
Sebastian is neat and tidy, both in his own appearance and his workspace—to
a fault. He showers often twice a day, disinfects regularly, and he'd
probably rather die than wear the same clothes two days in a row. This is
also why he's incredibly fluffy for an armadillo. Despite all the washing,
he's not exactly into fashion, so whatever's comfortable (and on the warmer
side through much of the year, given that armadillos have kinda terrible
internal heat regulation) works.

### Voice/speech patterns
Slightly nasal, precise in his word choice, and more than a little sweary
when he's upset, Sebastian's voice is hard to miss, whether you want to or
not. He's also often on the long-winded side (not that Catherine minds).

### Tics/nervous habits
You can often tell what's bothering Sebastian just by listening to the
noises and clipped phrases he mutters absentmindedly. He's also got a habit
of talking to himself, something that's stuck with him since his lonely
childhood.

## Personality
### Strengths
Fastidious and detail-oriented, Sebastian *embodies* the term "bean counter".
He's probably the guy you want running cables for meetings, big parties, and
town events (not that those happen too much in Apricot Bay). While it's hard
for him to show it even long into the storyline, Sebastian does care about
those he feels he has to protect and will put himself through much pain to
make things right if need be.

### Weaknesses
Sebastian is notoriously bad at managing stress, and especially prior to
meeting Cat (and to a lesser degree prior to his first encounter with The
Guardian of Apricot Bay), he will snap at people, often in public, without a
second thought. This earns him something of a reputation around town, and it
causes the Guardian to mistake him as The Spirit of The City attempting to
infiltrate Apricot Bay. (Or is it truly a mistake?)

### Hobbies
Living on the cutting edge of technology as always, Sebastian mostly spends
his off time browsing the internet (listen, he paid for a T1 line and he's
gonna make use of it, dammit) or, when it gets too noisy, hauling his laptop
off to the town cafe or Catherine's house and working there. On a less tech
geek-y note, once him and Catherine become more comfortable around her house,
he develops a taste for classic, rambling documentaries and indulges in board
games, a love he'd had since childhood but never had anyone to play with.

### Fears/insecurities
It's rather hard to tell sometimes if Sebastian just doesn't like people or
if he's actively afraid of them on some level. He means well, it's just that
new situations and people and crowds get him stressed and a bit defensive.
While initially, all he's got are Kevin and Penny for company, after he meets
Catherine, she gives him a sense of safety he's never quite experienced prior
to the move, which goes a long way towards alleviating some of his issues.

### Disorders/diseases
Because he's not used to being held accountable for his emotions, when
something's got Sebastian feeling strongly, he has a tendency to avoid
people, even those close to him, until it dissipates. There's also his
aforementioned pathological obsession with cleanliness. Sebastian *hates*
dirt, which is another reason people aren't usually allowed in his home.
(Penny and Kevin being dust bunnies seems almost comedically ironic.)
