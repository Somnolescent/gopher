PROJECT: Pennyverse
CREATOR: Caby (caby@somnolescent.net) and Cammy (mariteaux@somnolescent.net)

Pennyverse is an ongoing storytelling project involving the coinciding
stories of two recent arrivals to a tiny, overgrown, isolated coastal village
named Apricot Bay around the turn of the millennium, right in the midst of a
war between two neighboring settlement guardians. The perpetually-irritated
Sebastian and his chaotic friends Kevin and Penny make up one plotline; a
small, abandoned teenage raccoon named Colton, who's soon taken in by the old
gay bohemian hippie Art Gallery owner, makes up the other.

As they acclimate to the weather and to the town's strange but friendly
atmosphere, they soon learn the town and her Guardian's decay is the result
of a being called The Spirit of the City trying to cast disunity and misery
over its residents, causing them to pack up and leave, killing the Guardian
and the community she feeds off of, and claiming the land for City developers
to inadvertently help him sustain his own growth and power instead.

The Spirit plays dirty, coming in on the backs of the recent arrivals, but
will they stand as a reservoir for his powers forever, or will the town's
residents help ease their City folk tendencies before long?
