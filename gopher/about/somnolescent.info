===============================================================================

Somnolescent is an art collective and group of internet friends established
in 2018. Their interests are numerous--drawing, videos, ancient media, old
chunky tech, indie rock and ambient and terrible 2000s pop music you'd find
on Warrior Cats AMVs. They span the West, from the driftless north of
Minnesota to the castle ruins of Wales.

somnolescent.net is a big site network of everything they get up to
creatively and often personally. gopher.somnolescent.net is a plain text
repository of that creativity, focused on files to download. Art pieces,
music, stories, code by us and archived software not by us can all be browsed
in a low-overhead list format ideal for old PCs here.

SOMNOLIANS (AND BIOS)
===============================================================================
Cammy (mariteaux)
Caby's boyf, Somnol's webmaster, writer, drawer, level designer, musician...
Was a notorious Flareon in a past life. Confirmed for gay. Will steal all your
pillows in his sleep. Expect him at a record store near you. (For several
hours straight.)

Caby (...caby)
Soft hippie Welsh girl conjuring lush nature scenes from her big screen tablet.
Married to Cammy! Tends day and night to her herd of guinea pigs--four
currently, ten in all so far!

Lince (dotcomboom)
Somnol's resident software dev targeting your brand new Gateway PC. Huge fan of
plushies, frequent Furcadia flyer, and doodle dabbler. Owns and operates
Minnesota's first-ever retirement home for old computers.

Savannah (fivewholeducks)
Somnol's #1 fan of humans. Canadian (poor thing). Fond of clay sculptures,
Spyro, and self-deprecation. Using her experiences in marketing to write a
webcomic about vampires.

Connor (tai7k)
Singer/guitarist/composer/weeaboo with a cool sword. Somnolescent's second

fast track to having someone fuck his dad.

Jake (deleteyouremails)
Prolific sandwich photographer, part-time vlogger. Has work in the morning.
Despite better attempts, still does not have my home address. This Time He's
Really Gonna Do It.

Trys (cramble)
Ankle-length jorts enthusiast and programmer of world-class Roblox shitposts.
Caby's brother. Can eat a tin of cold beans in less than ten minutes. Last seen
trying to teach ChatGPT his conlang.

IN CASE YOU WERE CURIOUS...
===============================================================================
Q: What does "Somnolescent" mean?
A: It's a big pretentious word that means you're sleepy. Somnolians (those in
the group) tend to sleep rather poorly, though we don't encourage that...
That said, we like the peaceful vibe of the half hour or so before you head to
bed, so that's what we try to cultivate.

Q: When did Somnolescent get started?
A: Officially, our birthday is December 20, 2018. The name and bulb have
existed since Cammy was in middle school in 2012 or so, though.

Q: Why the half-bulb logo?
A: It's easy to draw and memorable. Is the bulb out? Is it on? It is both.

Q: Where can I talk to you guys?
A: At the moment, there's nowhere you can talk to us all at once, but we love
getting email! mariteaux, caby, dotcomboom, fwd, and connor @somnolescent.net
all work. Other contact info and profiles can be found on our sites.
