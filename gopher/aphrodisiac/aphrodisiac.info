PROJECT: aphrodisiac
CREATOR: Cammy (mariteaux@somnolescent.net)

aphrodisiac is a lo-fi instrumental industrial ambient music project started
by Cammy in his bedroom at age 16. The goal: like Big Black, but slightly
catchier, and like musical trauma, the clank of drum machines, old MP3
encoders, blown out synths, and disembodied, sampled voices sticks with him.

After a long absence after the release of his second EP, Cammy returned as
aphrodisiac with a batch of reworked songs under the title "In Free Fall" in
2019, with the hopes of getting down to a second (and perhaps final) album
when he can unbury himself from his pile of projects.

The tracks featured on this menu are all roughly telephone-quality WAVs. For
higher quality tracks in your choice of compression format, you can download
the finished material on his Bandcamp, also featured on this menu.
