AutoSite Legacy version history:

1.4 (January 12, 2024):
This release improves parity with AutoSite's Apricot engine. Sites that have
been made in that version of the program should now build correctly under
AutoSite Legacy.

   + modified attribute [#modified#] has been added. By default, the modified
   date is displayed in YYYY-MM-DD format, but this can be adjusted at build
   time with --modified. strftime format is followed, see here for a reference
   or check --help.
   + -s or --silent is now the preferred option for building without console
   output (-q still works)
   + Special attributes such as modified and root are set before user-defined
   ones. This means they can be overridden if necessary.
   - The pages/ directory is now used, rather than in/. (Keep this in mind
   when compiling old sites!)
   - Conditional text has been reworked such that checking for emptiness now
   works as it does in Apricot.

1.3 (October 20, 2019):
This is a Python 3 parity release that adds CommonMark support and template
caching.
