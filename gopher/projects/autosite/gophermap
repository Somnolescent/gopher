==== AUTOSITE =========================================================
0About AutoSite (for non-compliant clients)	autosite.info

AutoSite is dotcomboom's Visual Basic static site generator. The theory
goes that you build a page's layout a single time and use that page as
a template for further pages beyond that, with what actually changes
page-to-page (title, metadata, text content) being all you need to
write. This keeps each page consistent, with much less room for error
and far less effort needed to correct layout glitches.

AutoSite consists of two main parts, the building engine known as
Apricot, and the optional front-end for managing and editing site
pages. Variables and conditional text provide further control over the
rendered page, and as many templates as needed can be used in the case
of a more complex site. AutoSite is used on many sites featured around
Somnolescent's network and is extremely powerful and simple to use. As
of August 2021, AutoSite has gone gold and a full users manual (which
is mirrored here) is included with the program.

==== AUTOSITE (LATEST VERSION 1.0 GOLD) ===============================
AutoSite (formerly AutoSite XL) is the main version of the program,
written in Visual Basic .NET and Winforms. It should run well on very
old PCs (Windows 98 or later on any Pentium-class machine) and under
Wine. A command-line version named AutoSite Core that you can invoke
from a script is included. See the linked manual for further details.

==== AUTOSITE LEGACY (LATEST VERSION 1.4) =============================
AutoSite Legacy is written in Python and thus will run natively cross-
platform. Recent (~2024) updates have brought it up to feature parity
with main AutoSite and its Apricot building engine.

==== AUTOSITE '98 (LATEST VERSION 1999.12) ============================
The static site generator of the next millennium! Written by Bulb
Microcomputer Software Inc. in Visual Basic 6, many of the creature
comforts of later versions of AutoSite, like multiple template support,
were not yet introduced, so caution when using it.
