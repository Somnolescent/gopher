===============================================================================

AutoSite is dotcomboom's Visual Basic static site generator. The theory goes
that you build a page's layout a single time and use that page as a template
for further pages beyond that, with what actually changes page-to-page (title,
metadata, text content) being all you need to write. This keeps each page
consistent, with much less room for error and far less effort needed to
correct layout glitches.

AutoSite consists of two main parts, the building engine known as Apricot,
and the optional front-end for managing and editing site pages. Variables and
conditional text provide further control over the rendered page, and as many
templates as needed can be used in the case of a more complex site. AutoSite
is used on many sites featured around Somnolescent's network and is extremely
powerful and simple to use. As of August 2021, AutoSite has gone gold and a
full users manual (which is mirrored here) is included with the program.

This menu links to binaries and version history for AutoSite, AutoSite Legacy
(a Python script) and AutoSite '98, the static site generator of the next
millenium from Bulb Microcomputer Software Inc. and written in Visual Basic 6.
(Many of the creature comforts of later versions of AutoSite, like multiple
template support, were not yet introduced, so caution when using it.)
