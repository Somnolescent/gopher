==== PITUOPHIS AND GOPHEW =============================================
0About Pituophis and Gophew (for non-compliant clients)	pituophis.info

Pituophis is a full Gopher library written in Python 3. Powerful and
flexible, Pituophis can request and parse data over the Gopher protocol
or serve it out if desired. It supports Gopher over TLS, arbitrary
ports, gophermap parsing, Bucktooth-like globbing, type guessing, and
gophertags, and requires minimal dependencies.

Gophew is a Python 3 Gopher crawler and search-enabled server that runs
atop Pituophis. Gophew consists of two scripts, a customizable crawler
script that generates an index of selectors in JSON, and Gophew, a
frontend for Pituophis with a special handler for requests to
"/search". (Gophew can be used to crawl Gopherspace as a whole, but due
to the stringent limits server owners often put on bot activity, it's
not recommended. Be respectful.)

Somnolescent's server acts as a working demo of Gophew and Pituophis
run in tandem. Try searching for, say, "Astraware", or "Colton".
