===============================================================================

Pituophis is a full Gopher library written in Python 3. Powerful and flexible,
Pituophis can request and parse data over the Gopher protocol or serve it out
if desired. It supports Gopher over TLS, arbitrary ports, gophermap parsing,
Bucktooth-like globbing, type guessing, and gophertags, and requires minimal
dependencies. Somnolescent's Gopher server is powered by Pituophis.

To demonstrate its client capabilities, TreeGopher is packed in with recent
versions of Pituophis. TreeGopher also acts as a proof of concept for dcb's
ideal Gopher client, featuring such things as a tree view and inline display
of text and images.

Gophew is a Python 3 Gopher crawler and search-enabled server that runs atop
Pituophis. Gophew consists of two scripts, a customizable crawler script that
generates an index of selectors in JSON, and Gophew, a frontend for
Pituophis with a special handler for requests to "/search". (Gophew can be
used to crawl Gopherspace as a whole, but due to the stringent limits server
owners often put on bot activity, it's not recommended. Be respectful.)

Somnolescent's server acts as a working demo of Gophew and Pituophis run in
tandem. Try searching for, say, "Astraware", or "Colton".
