gSummer Swim [small, 157KB]	swimmy.gif
Gotta start off with a lil relationship art,, Cammy as an otter and
Caby as a wolf, enjoying a nice refreshing swim while the weather's
nice. We're both rather excited for the first time we'll be able
to swim together in person, speaking as sea monsters ourselves...

Some gift art Caby decided to do for Savannah's in-progress webcomic
Wisp! This is Heidi, one of the witches in the coven out in the
woods. She has a gigantic scythe. Do you have a gigantic scythe?

gKyra's Conspiracy [small, 159KB]	kyra.gif
In early 2023, Caby and Cammy set about to work on a book for her
college final, Cammy writing, Caby illustrating. They elected to go
with a Pennyverse story about two characters, Kevin, an aardwolf,
and Theophrastus, the town's old bunny librarian, traveling through
the Multiverse in search of Theo's old home universe. Here, a crazy
person named Kyra shows them all her work investigating the
Multiverse to their dismay.

THROUGH THE LOST DESERT (APRIL 5, 2023)

gThrough the Lost Desert [small, 141KB]	lostdesert.gif
Another illustration done for Kevin and Theo. As the book has the duo
traveling through different universes, Caby had to do her best Neopets
style impression here--which wasn't too hard, not just because she's
talented, but because Neopets is one of her long-standing influences!

APRICOT BAY PUBLIC LIBRARY (SEPTEMBER 24, 2022)

A big group pic of various folks' Pennyverse characters gathered at the
library for a book club! From left to right, Catherine, Clarissa,
Arthur, Lia, Madeleine, Ryan, and Kevin (who can't quite read, though
he's got the spirit). If you're curious, you can look any of these lads
up in SomnolCCSO on the root menu of our Gopher server...

EIRIAN (JULY 30, 2022)

gEirian [small, 149KB]	eirian.gif
An "attack" (gift art) done during Art Fight 2023, an online art
trading game played every July. This was of a flowery doggy girl in a
bright yellow dress named Eirian, who was fittingly on Team Bloom
during the event.
