CHUNKY MAC (JANUARY 4, 2024)
IChunky Mac [224KB]	cammywip.png
gChunky Mac [small, 81KB]	cammywip.gif
Cammy's main sona, a ginger badger named, uh, Cammy. This is his new
desig with him in a maroon button-up and slacks, because he's a nerd
and doesn't mind the dress code. This illustration was done for the
"coming soon" page on mariteaux.somnolescent.net, hence the Compact Mac
with the famous "HELLO" screen instead reading "WIP!".

DEVON (NOVEMBER 11, 2023)
IDevon [277KB]	devon.png
gDevon [small, 90KB]	devon.gif
Gift art trying to welcome a now-former Somnolian back into the group.
This was her sona, a European wildcat in a green sweater and glasses.
The layered shading style and use of purple to shade was a pretty
successful experiment, if I say so myself.

TECHY CAMMY (OCTOBER 31, 2023)
ITechy Cammy [216KB]	cammy_sitting.png
gTechy Cammy [small, 130KB]	cammy_sitting.gif
Another one of Cammy, this time him sitting and working on a laptop
drawn in an airbrush-y watercolor-y style. He works on people's PCs,
for that is what Cammy does for a job in real life as well.

ADVENTURE! (OCTOBER 13, 2023)
IAdventure! [335KB]	magical.png
gAdventure! [small, 122KB]	magical.gif
Featuring a magical Bunny and Setter, two of Caby and Cammy's sonas,
respectively. A somewhat last-minute illustration for a section of
cammy.somnol detailing his visit to Wales to see her.

CRAIG (SEPTEMBER 30, 2023)
ICraig [117KB]	craig.png
gCraig [small, 55KB]	craig.gif
Something slightly belatedly done for dcb's birthday. This is an arctic
wolf merchant character he has named Craig. What he lacks in wares that
pass the smell test, he makes up for in gosh-darn spirit.

WAVING KAPY (JULY 5, 2023)
IWaving Kapy [149KB]	kapy.png
gWaving Kapy [small, 53KB]	kapy.gif
Another of Caby's sonas, a strawberry tiger girl named Kaplan. She
waves at you. This was one of the first drawings done with Cammy's big,
shiny eye style and he's still very fond of it.
