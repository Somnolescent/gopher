LINCE (SEPTEMBER 11, 2023)
ILince [48KB]	lince.png
gLince [small, 22KB]	lince.gif
dcb's main sona, a lynx named Lince. All that fur must generate some
crazy static electricity when he's inside a computer, huh?

CRAIGDACHI (MAY 23, 2023)
ICRAIGDACHI [251KB]	craigdachi.png
gCRAIGDACHI [small, 63KB]	craigdachi.gif
Craig is normally an arctic fox (either in plushie form or in Pinede
fantasy traveling salesman form--check Cammy's art menu for that), but
here, he's a Gamedachi, an open species Caby created of sapient
plushies based on old electronic gizmos with screen faces. He's a media
player Gamedachi, USB 2.0 for charging and data transfer, and plays
PlaysForSure DRM-encoded files, if you buy your music like a square.

CHRISTMAS CEDRUS (APRIL 20, 2023)
IChristmas Cedrus [143KB]	cedrus.png
gChristmas Cedrus [small, 53KB]	cedrus.gif
Cedrus is a Bori--you remember Neopets, yeah? In keeping with dcb's
eternal festive nature, he's a Christmas-colored Bori, complete with
holly on his tail. Aww.

INFINITY WAR (MARCH 11, 2023)
IInfinity War [445KB]	infinitywar.jpg
gInfinity War [small, 64KB]	infinitywar_small.jpg
All of dcb's sonas! One of the rare pencil sketches to be included in
the Somnol Art Gallery, but this one was just too awesome to resist.

COLLIE (DECEMBER 7, 2022)
ICOLLIE [862KB]	collie.jpg
ICOLLIE [small, 100KB]	collie_small.jpg
Collie (lots of C-named characters in here, huh?) is, well, a border
collie, and dcb's "Wynsona" (that is, our self-representation in Caby's
weird psychological rural Welsh world starring her Scottish fold kitty
Wyn). This one was done in Rebelle, a traditional medium simulating art
program we all bought and should use more, given the price...

MERRY CHRISTMAS 2021! (DECEMBER 24, 2021)
IMerry Christmas 2021 [94KB]	snakedcb.jpg
dcb's original sona was a bright green snake, sorta like the snake in
the Google emotes. This was a Christmas thing with lots of textures,
something dcb is still quite fond of.
