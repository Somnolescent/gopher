==== THE SOMNOLESCENT ART GALLERY =====================================
0About the Somnolescent Art Gallery (for non-compliant clients)	gallery.info

Somnolescent believes there's not enough visual art in Gopherspace--
illustrations, design, modeling, any of it. We've picked some favorites
from our own galleries and we bring them to you here.

Each submenu is devoted to a different artist in the group. In case you
truly are browsing on a retro machine or over a very slow connection,
we provide lower quality, smaller downloads for each image alongside
the full-sized original. These will be in GIF format, while the full
images are often in PNG. File sizes are listed with their selectors.
