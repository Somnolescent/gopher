BARCLAY, LIGHTNING ARCHER (JANUARY 23, 2024)
IBarclay, Lightning Archer [648KB]	storm.png
gBarclay, Lightning Archer [small, 127KB]	storm.gif
Barclay is an old raccoon lad of Savannah's, recently overhauled and
brought into Pinede, one of our group worlds featuring fantasy animal
people. When he grows up, he's gonna become a lightning mage--an
affectionate one, but still a zappy boy with a cool outfit.

DOM (JANUARY 1, 2024)
IDom [564KB]	dom.png
gDom [small, 110KB]	dom.gif
Dom is one of the two protagonists of Savannah's upcoming webcomic
epic, Wisp. Fittingly, he's a vampire paranormal investigator with a
tendency to emotionally suck people dry. Not physically, though, he's
got coconut water for that. He's civilized. This is an icon of him done
for his toyhou.se profile.

SNOWBEAR (DECEMBER 18, 2023)

gSnowbear [small, 112KB]	snowbear.gif
A cute little winter scene for Pennyverse, one of our group worlds.
These characters are some of Savannah's--a trio of little kid
filmmakers and the older brother of one of them. From left to right,
their names are Rory, Jo, Nate, and Hubie.

CASS (SEPTEMBER 5, 2023)

gCass [small, 101KB]	cass.gif
Cass is the other protagonist of Wisp, a hypercompetent pushover who's
one half of the Wisp paranormal suppression agency. Also she can turn
into a werewolf. This is an icon of her done for the fall of 2023.

ROCKSTAR (JULY 5, 2023)
IRockstar [1.2MB]	rockstar.png
gRockstar [small, 150KB]	rockstar.gif
An "attack" (gift art) done during Art Fight 2023, an online art
trading game played every July. This one is of a character called Hale
Sturm. Savannah is still very into this drawing--it's very dynamic, and
personally, I really like how the guitar came out.

ART FIGHT 2023! (JULY 4, 2023)
IArt Fight 2023 [94KB]	fight.png
gArt Fight 2023 [small, 70KB]	fight.gif
Another Art Fight attack, this one featuring all the sonas of the (at
the time) Somnolians who participated (and Setter :flushed:).
