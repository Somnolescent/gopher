PROJECT: AutoSite
MAINTAINER: dotcomboom (dotcomboom@somnolescent.net)

AutoSite is dcb's Visual Basic static site generator. The theory goes that
you build a page's layout a single time and use that page as a template for
further pages beyond that, with what actually changes page-to-page (title,
metadata, text content) being all you need to write. This keeps each page
consistent, with much less room for error and far less effort needed to
correct layout glitches.

AutoSite consists of two main parts, the building engine known as Apricot,
and the optional front-end for managing and editing site pages. Variables and
conditional text provide further control over the rendered page, and as many
templates as needed can be used in the case of a more complex site. AutoSite
is used on many sites featured around Somnolescent's network and is extremely
powerful and simple to use. As of August 2021, AutoSite has gone gold and a
full users manual (which is mirrored here) is included with the program.

This menu links to binaries and version history for AutoSite, including
Legacy AutoSite (a Python script) and AutoSite '98, the static site generator
of the next millenium from Bulb Microcomputer Software Inc. and written in
Visual Basic 6. (Of course, many of the creature comforts of AutoSite, like
subdirectories and multiple template support, were introduced in later
versions, so its use is not recommended.)
