# Recap #13: Sleeping Through the Dog Daysun
## August 31 2020
### From gopher.somnolescent.net, the Gopherhole of the weird lightbulb people
Well, admittedly, it's been a slower month than expected here at
Somnolescent. Turns out, after a month-long sprint (two, in my case...),
mostly, you wanna relax. Relax we did, and so, by the time we got back in the
productive spirit, it was the last week or two of the month. As such, the
pickings are a little paltry this time (and admittedly no Pennyverse Month–
we're aiming for September). Still, can't finish the month without a recap,
so here we go...

## An Arrogant Pawn of the Kuras
So writing from me dried up towards the end of June thanks to a surprise
*Quake* level I was called on to build. For years now (since before I started
modding *Quake*!), my friend NewHouse has been at work on a three episode
expansion called *The Dark Saga*, and he needed a good ending for the first
episode, *Blue*, and figured I had more to offer than I'd left behind. I
always intended to return to *Quake* after I came to a less-than-amicable end
with some of the community people, so I took him up on the offer.

Originally, the level was called "Arrogant Erratum", for the original
concept: arrogance has consequences, while waiting and humility makes a man
powerful in the end. The second half of the level (now its own level) goes
back to my old Calelira lore and a level I'd actually planned to build back
in 2018 involving the old Kuras strongholds and catacombs. In total, this
thing took 52 days and splitting into two maps to complete (because I blew
right past *Quake*‘s level size limit...), but man, am I pleased with it.

It's not released yet, since it needs a bit of retooling and balancing, but
it'll be available as the end two levels of Blue and as a standalone vanilla
("id1", as it's known) epic. If you want to read more about its development,
go check the *Quake* blog tag on my Scratchpad.

## Right, writing...

Remember borb's Sophius story from June? Finally got my own Sophius story
from June finished. It's called "Thylacine in the Sea", and it's probably
the story I'm most proud of to date. It's not perfect, nothing is, but I
love the descriptions and the way it plays out. Came out exactly as I wanted
it to.

As far as Calelira goes now, it's pretty much just that "The Fatal Commons"
needs a rewrite. After that, my first rocky, shaky little fantasy world will
be at rest.

## AutoSite inches closer
Another release candidate of AutoSite is out, so if you're on the bus (and
you damn well should be), go grab it. It works nicer on Windows 98 and
works nicer in general (including a spiffy new Quick Insert menu and a whole
load of visual polish), especially if you have the window layout customized.

As for what's leading up to the gold release, dcb has been getting the thing
out to various download and shareware sites (Softpedia gave it a very
glowing review), and we'd (yes, plural, I'll be helping like I did for Legacy
AutoSite) like to massively improve the documentation for AutoSite before
it's official, including a sample project. (Plus giving it the full subsite
treatment, probably styled like an old-school freeware site because really,
that's where AutoSite's DNA comes from.)

We're coming up on a whole year of .Net AutoSite, lads. Time flies.

## Blog highlights
And the *Letters* glacier crawls as usual. Admittedly, two of the group blog
posts are me (also as usual), but trust me, there's some drafts in the works
on the backend from the other lads that you should watch for. (dcb's got one
on using an old phone as a server I'm really curious to read in full.) As for
what's out there right now though:

- On Confidence by mariteaux (July 9): "And that's not a blackpill, that's
the most freeing thing I can say. There is no audience to please just yet.
It's cool to write stuff only I like, and the same goes for you."
- More old Macs! by mon (August 8): "So I decided to do the impossible and
open up my iBook G4 just to install OS 9 on the Powerbook G3's hard drive."
- Vaders and Venetian Blinds: A Review of "Racing the Beam" by mariteaux
(July 17): "Seriously, if you're not turned off by the discussion of color
clocks and assembler instructions, *Racing the Beam* is a highly recommended
read."

There's a lot more going on that I can't really devote recap segments to:
Caby and I have been worldbuilding and hoarding art and story fragments for
it, borb, Caby, and mon are all seeing some pretty major improvements to
their bedrooms and workspaces (what this means for you: hopefully more
regular content), and dcb and mon are back to school. Something I think about
every so often is that there'll likely come a day where the monthly recaps
just stop being feasible. Life will take over. Right now, we're a bunch of
bedroom-bound college-aged kids doodling and tinkering, but we'll be out in
the proper world sooner rather than later, with jobs and kids, out exploring
and maybe even meeting in person, just like they used to do on the ~old
internet~.

Mmmh, wistful. Sounds fantastic, honestly.
