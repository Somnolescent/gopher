# Recap #5: Chunky Soup
## October 31, 2019
### From gopher.somnolescent.net, the Gopherhole of the weird lightbulb people
If you haven't yet noticed, you've had 30 entire days to do so: it's spooky
month. This does not in any way call for a recap, but here we are nonetheless.
Nowhere near as long as the last one, promise. Come! There's Eevees!

## Caby's Annual Halloween Shenanigans
As seems to happen every year around this time, Caby has brought out her
piggo mascots for Halloween. This year, Candy Corn leads the group astray,
into the twisted woods for...something or another. You don't have much longer
to read it (November 1st or so...), so get in while you can.

## Continued AutoSite XL Development
Meanwhile, dotcomboom continues to toil away at AutoSite XL. Getting awful
close to a 1.0 gold release, and it's matured considerably in the last two
months. If you're still not sure what it is, I like to call it a templating
engine where your pages are linked to easily-manageable templates; hundreds
of pages can be rebuilt with a few quick changes, without the need for
scripting or loading data after the fact. It spits out pure, speedy, static
HTML for when you need pure, speedy, static HTML.

It's incredibly useful, as someone who's used it since the Python days, and
now that it's got a lightweight GUI and an editor and everything, you have no
reason not to try it out. In fact, I recently rebuilt my site to use it,
which should save me some hassle for future updates.

## Misery Inspires
And speaking of my sites, my very first one is now online! A redone version
of it, anyway. The desire to do an old-school fansite for a band I adore
(Silversun Pickups) has been with me even before I joined Neocities, but I
was never quite able to finish it the way I wanted to. It was too much work,
and work I didn't exactly want to do for that matter. For three years, two
different builds of it languished in my website folder, which was a damn
shame. I had so much researched and poured into it, it really deserved better.

But thanks to Caby's hype and a sudden scaling back of plans, Misery Inspires
is now a thing on the actual internet. I'd ideally like to add more photo
galleries and interviews and whatnot, but as of right now, I'm really rather
pleased with it.

Working on this site (and recently seeing the Pickups on tour) has really
rekindled my interest in the band and the Silver Lake music scene as a whole.
I've been a little rabid about tracking down some ephemera and rare CD-Rs
from the time period to show off, but getting ripped off has slowed those
plans down. Here's hoping my attempts to contact Aaron Espinoza aren't in
vain, because I have a lot to write about. In the meantime, here's an ancient
SSPU demo I unearthed.

## Pennyverse Happenings
It's still a little quiet and dormant, but I did write two little stories
featuring Apricot Bay's own cryptid, Gonzo, "To Exhaustion" and
"Classifieds". He's a fun character to write for, definitely a little beast
in his own right. There'll be more to come of it when I'm in a little more
of a writing mood, promise.

## Infrastructure Improvements
We're pretty much forcing HTTPS across our entire domain now. A lot of our
HTTP traffic came from bots and most of our sites don't work on Netscape
anyway. If there comes a time when minerteaux comes back out of the closet or
what have you, we can disable it per-site (or per-directory, perhaps), but
for now, you'll need something newer than IE8 to peek.

I have a ton of plans to beef up Somnolescent's architecture come next year,
and I'll be outlining those in a later blog post. In fact, as dead as the
blog's been lately, there'll be tons of updates in December (and Somnol's
one-year anniversary!), so grab an RSS reader and get comfy.

In the meantime, we're going trick-or-treating.
