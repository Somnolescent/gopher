# Recap #4: Blueberry Milk
## September 9, 2019
### From gopher.somnolescent.net, the Gopherhole of the weird lightbulb people
Two new sites, bios and refs, stories, a little raccoon out on a giant
adventure, and I've started playing Cookie Clicker again. This one's gonna be
so massive, I've had to split it into sections, so get cozy in the nearest
armchair. It's time for a recap.

## New Sites
Somnolescent's newest member, mon (ya might know him as paperbagthing if
you're of a certain lineage), has finally gotten his site up! Music and
guinea pigs (that makes two of them now...) abound from the deer boy. On the
other end of the spectrum (:3c), one of Somnolescent's older members, borb,
is back on the site thing over on her subdomain. Content coming soon, I hear.

Unlike me, Caby, or dcb, mon and borb didn't actually know HTML or CSS going
into making their sites, so they've had to learn as they go along, hence the
slowness. But all good, they've been vigilant, and we're gonna hopefully be
seeing more from them in the future.

## Colton's Adventure
Back in June, I wanted to try my hand at a quest hidden in my site, a text
adventure of sorts starring my little sad raccoon guy Colton. It's finally
out. This is ~13,662 words of Pennyverse goodness (for the record, I
currently have 13,333 words currently on toyhou.se, so over doubled my count
there), letting you explore the outskirts of the Valley Cascadia surrounding
the town or meet some of the weirdos in town themselves. Both paths terminate
in new stories from me.

Getting this done was an absolute battle of nerves and weariness throughout;
it's the single most writing I've ever done in a single go. All in all,
though, I think it came out nicely. Because of its length and the amount of
work it took, I've elected to not hide it after all. Please go poke at it,
it'd make me a happy Cammy.

## The Results of Pennyverse Month
Oh, and if you clicked on that link to Colton's bio up there? You might've
noticed a massively overhauled toyhou.se profile, and that's just one of the
many things we got up to during the first annual Pennyverse Month, where we
dedicated the entire month of August to writing stories, improving the world
on toyhou.se, drawing, and just getting a load of ideas out there. We did so
much that I basically have to list everything to get it all in.

- As said, we've rewritten all the bios for all the Pennyverse lads. I came
up with a more detailed bio template that actually focuses on the important
stuff about a character, and everyone seemed to like it a lot, so we went
with it. Aside from the trio, who were more collaborative between Caby and I,
everyone wrote the bios for their own characters (so borb did Arthur, Caby
did Catherine, Diesel, Giulio, and Madeleine, and I did Colton, Gonzo, the
Guardian, Riley, and then the trio.)
- Caby did refs for every last character, and you can see the whole lot over
in the new DeviantArt group. Their personality shots are also featured on
their bios.
- Of course, I didn't let the opportunity go to waste without a bit of
writing, and ended up doing two one-shots, one of Madeleine getting the
fuzzies over Colton singing and playing guitar, and the other of Kevin
hopping the multiverse and meeting some of my old Calelira characters. I
also finished two proper plot stories for the two endings of Colton's
Adventure: Orchard Peak, which terminates the forest path, and Sebastian
vs. the Guardian, which terminates the town path.
- Caby also did some writing, a story about how absolutely vile Diesel is.
Betcha didn't know she could write, did you?

## Otherwhere
Of course, I can't just stop at one project, and after reading too much
Teenage Victory Songs (come back, soyrev!), I thought it'd be fun to start
a songblog of my own. I also wanted to try out Dreamhost's WordPress
integration and not have to build yet another site from scratch. Thus,
Otherwhere, where I'm trying to write a bit about every Failure song ever
released.

A new entry comes out every Friday. The order's randomized between their
six or so albums, so I'm getting a nice blend of old and new Failure to
talk about, and hopefully you're finding some stuff to listen to.

## AutoSite XL
In news I'm rather excited about, dotcomboom's taken the time to retool the
already incredibly useful AutoSite into a lightweight site management app
with a GUI and a nice tree view and a built-in editor. If you have a static
site and need a templating engine for keeping your pages consistent,
AutoSite's rock solid, and now that there's a proper desktop version, I'll
probably go back to using it for my next site redesign.

## Site Optimizations
I've been playing with and tuning up the site for funsies here and there.
I'm still very very new to how `.htaccess` works and I'm likely to break more
than I fix, but Dreamhost lets you use them, so I've been playing with them
for various caching and redirection things. I'm also likely to start
enforcing either HTTP or HTTPS per subdomain for logging purposes. (Case in
point, somnolescent.net now forces HTTPS. An experiment for now, and if
Google really does favor HTTPS sites, I think that's a fair tradeoff for
losing Netscape support, which can't handle my chrome-plated HTML anyway.)

By the way, did you know we keep logs? IPs, user agent strings, referrers,
the works. This means nothing for 95% of you, but for the 5% of people with
certain...inclinations, we see you~ (That means you can stop obsessively
archiving stuff now, Jimmy.)

Also, did you know the blog has had RSS this entire time and I completely
forgot to link it in the custom theme? I'm smart. Here you go, use your
favorite Discord bot or reader to know when we've updated.

Oh, and I wrote a humans.txt, because dead memes are fun.

## Anniversary!
The one year anniversary of me inviting Caby and dcb into the group just
passed, by the way. I consider August 31, 2018 to be the day Somnolescent
started to change from the kinda miserable, nothingy "friend" group it was
before to a proper group, something to be proud of being a part of, honestly.
There was a hell of a lot of nerves at the start, and a bunch of awful
people had to leave before it wasn't a shitshow, but at this point we're as
solid and stable as we've ever been. And that? Is a good feeling.

Infinitely glad you two are still with us. Hoping you're still Somnolians
long into the future.

## And on...
Mmm, what else? I wrote some stuff for TCRF, if you're into Guitar Hero. Oh,
and I finally edited that SimCity stream supercut like I wanted to, still a
classic. And I saw Silversun Pickups in concert! I Don't Know How But They
Found Me opened for them, and even if the sound at the show was dogshit, they
took me by total surprise when they played Beck's "Debra" and Dallas, their
singer, absolutely killed it. Plus they just kicked ass anyway. And the
Pickups played "Common Reactor", so I was pleased.

But enough waffle. Where to from here? Well, obviously we're not keeping up
this level of busyness into September. School's starting for some of our
members, I'm exhausted, and real life stuff keeps tugging at my shirt.
Pennyverse is going quiet, at least for me, until October and then December,
when I have special things planned for it. Likely, we're all just gonna play
vidya and fuck around for a bit. A well-deserved break, I'd say.
