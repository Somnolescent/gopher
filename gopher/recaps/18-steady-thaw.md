# Recap #18: Steady Thaw
## April 5, 2021
### From gopher.somnolescent.net, the Gopherhole of the weird lightbulb people
What a difference two weeks makes! You might remember we just outright skipped
last month's recap because winter depression is a *bitch*. Just like 2020
though, things always seem to heat up right before April (well, it was before
April when I started this...). Something in the air about it...and hey,
growing season starts soon! Better get your overalls out...

## Who said you needed 480p anyway?
Here's a fun little project to start us off. dcb, seeing that there was
virtually no way to watch YouTube on an Windows Mobile device, got to work.
The result's winvid, a Flask app that takes a video URL (or search term and
the first video that comes up), downloads it, crunches it, and gives it to
you to download. The WMV-encoded videos come out tiny (we're talking 2MB a
minute!), yet still completely watchable, even on a desktop. Give it a shot
on that Windows 98 or Pocket PC in your life. (It's just youtube-dl, so I'm
told support for other sites may be soon as well? That'd be so sick, watching
through my subscriptions on XP...)

## And IE5 oughta be good enough for anybody
And Devon redesigned her site once more! Given how big into design she is,
her designs always skew to the spirited side, and yeah, this one's clean.
Imagemaps, fits in a 640Ã—480 window, and works in IE5. I love that navigation
at the bottom too. Such a clean, minimal way to get links to all your other
favorite Somnolians and non-Somnolians in there.

## You're moving to the (Furdew) valley
While this isn't the truly public announcement of what Caby and I have been
up to for the past three months, it's the first time it's been down in
writing (I think). Furdew Valley, a coming Content Patcher pack for *Stardew
Valley* that--well, see if you can't guess:

This one's been in Caby's head ever since *Stardew* came out, really. While
she'd toyed with .xnb mods in the past, the newer tools deterred her from
properly pursuing it until I stepped in. She's been working on the art and
sprites, and I've been implementing it and looking for other various things
to add or fix (new cutscenes and references to the Somnol Multiverse are on
the list...)

As for when it'll come out...when it's done. It's getting close (seriously, I
think two giftable NPCs left, and all the marriage candidates are finished),
but when it's done. No pressure on the girl doing all the cute art. u///u

## Pain world
And speaking of mods, borb's been off having fun with her real friends! Nah,
I'm just fucking around. (That's mon.) She's part of the *Rain World* modding
scene, doing art for what some people are calling "the most impressive joke
mod ever made for this game". Only it's not actually a joke.

If giving a slugcat a gigantic glowing sword sounds like your idea of a good
time, be sure to be on the lookout for the Dragonslayer mod sometime later in
the year. Probably. borb made me add this in afterwards and I didn't think to
ask for a date.

## Coming attractions?
I don't normally throw "what's upcoming" stuff into recaps (though maybe I
should start), but the blog's starting to heat up again, so it's appropriate.
Of course, recently I celebrated my third mariversary, and in a few days now,
that fateful on again-off again music sharing series airchecks once more. I
even saw a new draft from dcb lying around while I was finishing this one up!
Hell, maybe we can even get mon in here long enough to finish that draft
that's been sitting in the post list since *June 9, 2020*.

Beyond that, I've got *lots* to keep me occupied going into the summer, and
believe me--the Somnolians do too. Keep watching our blogs and our statuses
for further details as they follow. Steady thaw now.
