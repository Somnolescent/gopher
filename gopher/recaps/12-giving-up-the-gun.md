# Recap #12: Giving Up the Gun
## July 29, 2020
### From gopher.somnolescent.net, the Gopherhole of the weird lightbulb people
Last month's recap was a bit of a laugh and an admission that we just didn't
have much desire to interact with the outside world. The world of MSN
Messenger and IRC and chunky CRTs and old websites was more appealing to us,
and I was on a self-imposed tech timeout after spending May fighting with
Linux. (It still fucking sucks as a desktop OS and you know it.)

Not that we weren't active, of course; things were drawn, sites were built, I
write once more--all the good stuff you expect from us. I'll try not to
ramble, there's much to get through.

## A site? About Neopets? Never
Gotta love impulse projects--Caby's been meaning to dig up her old Neopets art
for a while now, and given a certain itch to get back to having fun with site
building, now seemed like the perfect time. Enter her Neopets shrine. It's
got her history with the site, bios for her Neopets, and of course, lots and
*lots* of adorable Caby art, both new and old, much of which has never been
seen in full quality before. (Damn art gallery and their 2003 file format
requirements...)

## In other site news...
### mari's Gopher Repository is Complete!
May, along with Somnolescent's Gopher server itself, saw the return of my
old Gopher Information Repository. Last year, I left it in an embarrassing
state, and although May found it looking much better, I still hadn't
finished it. Indeed, I took a total tech sabbatical for June, leading to a
few smaller projects piling up, one being finishing this section of my site.

Good news is, it's now totally feature-complete. Not to say it can't still
be expanded, of course, but all the pages exist now and they go into far
greater depth than even the old Information Repository intended to.
(Documenting UMN gopherdâ€˜s .cap and .link system of customizing menus, server
and DNS setup, and technical documents relating to Gopher+ and URI schemes
are just a few bits of what's on offer.) Come visit the much-easier-on-the-
keyboard mari's Gopher Repository and get your fill of highly organized
document retrieval if you're into that sorta thing like we seem to be.

### Extensible Eurasian Lynx
A long time in the making, dcb's overhauled his site again. Fitting with all
the retro web goodness we've been indulging in (more on that in a moment),
this one's written in good ol' XHTML 1.0 Strict and designed to evoke the
waning era of the internet. Very appealing look, and good colors too.

Far from being just a visual makeover, this one's actually a total
reorganization, making finding all of his photos, software, and projects of
various stripes much easier. He's also been putting more a focus on his
general interests; check his music page for a nice variety of blissy,
shoegazey recommendations and soundtracks.

### The Great Somnolescent Retablening
I found it rather dismaying trying out our sites on the eMachines box, only
to discover they don't work because I built them with much newer technology
than the browsers commonly used on XP can support. Therefore, following
Caby's lead, and with the new goal of targeting RetroZilla, I rebuilt
somnolescent.net, *Letters From Somnolescent*, and my personal site from the
ground up using tables for layouts instead, among other tweaks for optimal
old browser enjoyment.

While there's certainly visual tweaks that occurred in the Retablening, the
changes were largely under-the-hood. I'm satisfied with what came of it. If
you're the type to be scared of loading anything without heavy encryption and
a VPN, get HTTPS Everywhere and quit complaining. Otherwise, bask in the
cleartext glory with your favorite retro browser of choice.

### Friends of Somnol (and IRC!)
Not to say the update didn't come with any additional content. In the
interests of expanding out Somnolescent's interactions with the greater
community, we've introduced the Friends of Somnolescent page, at the moment
featuring three folks who've linked to us and who run pretty neat ships of
their own. Check 'em out.

On that same note, while we've had a private IRC room on SlashNET for a
little while now, ever since I joined all the Foonetic refugees moving to it
in the wake of said network's collapse (RIP Foonetic), we only recently got
the idea of making a second room available to the public. Enter **#somnol**.
You'll need an IRC client to connect, but thankfully not much setup is
involved. See our new IRC page for further details.

### The WordPress Theme Archive
And completing the trifecta of old internet ephemera, WordPress themes! I've
always found it a little funny the way old WordPress themes get good and
buried within a few years. Seriously, looking up anything WordPress-related
on Google just gives you an avalanche of shitty current year content mills
and opportunistic web hosts. Makes troubleshooting a pain, and makes finding
non-2020 themes a nightmare. And why specifically would you want to find old
WordPress themes? Couldn't be that new themes are all bloated to hell and
look the same. Definitely not.

With dcb's help, the entirety of the former WordPress.net Theme Gallery have
been scraped and thrown into my downloads folder to be categorized. More
relevantly for you, a bunch of them have already been posted in what I'm
calling the WordPress Theme Archive, with more to come. At the moment, I'm
currently working on reworking the old Districts (!) generation Legacy
AutoSite plugin for gallery purposes, given how much of a pain working the
HTML by hand is, and how inflexible AutoSite .NET is for this exact purpose.

There's a lot of work to be done here, but this is looking promising.

## And on the writing front!
### "Back to the Sunrise"

I was hoping to have more on Pennyverse for you all, but alas, a surprise
project from an old *Quake* friend has been taking up my time instead.
(That'll be in the next recap, so stay tuned.) In case you missed it, I
finally broke ground on the whole Pennyverse thing again this year with a bit
of a sequel to "Sebastian vs. the Guardian", that being "Back to the
Sunrise". Despite my nerves refusing to die completely, I don't mind this one
when I actually read it. I think that's a good sign.

### "Scent Trail"

And pleasantly surprising, borb actually got a little story of her own done!
It involves a lad of hers from way back, Sophius Brink the thylacine, out in
the desert stealing shinies from a cave. It's called "Scent Trail". Been
trying to encourage her to do much of anything with her OCs, and hopefully
now that Art Fight's on its way out, we can get some more good work out of
her.

## Decommissioning the filebase
Really, in news that has no relevance to you but a little to the group, I
made the decision to shutter the Somnolescent filebase I started back in
January and reclaim the drive that it was using. No one was really using it
other than me, it was never perfect in operation (I've had a few scares where
I thought the drive failed because it got bumped, thus stopping it from being
read, plus ext4 is fucking junk in the first place), and the drive's LED is
obnoxiously bright at night. Cammy's gotta sleep too,,,

Of course, the Raspberry Pi the filebase used is going nowhere, and neither
is the Gopherhole also being run on it. If anything, the Pi's now opened up
to a wider variety of uses; I've got ZNC running on it now for staying logged
into IRC on multiple machines, for example, and it might be host to an IRC
daemon of its own someday. The drive itself is now wiped (data's safe, all
good) and using a file system for sane people.

And with Art Fight on its way out, we transition into Pennyverse Month. Yes,
our long-neglected group world finally gets back to business next month! I
promise it won't all be soap opera material, I just tend to write that for
it. Much to do. Also, what's that I hear about a new world ripe for
exploration on the horizon...?
