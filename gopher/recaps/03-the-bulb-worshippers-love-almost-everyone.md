# Recap #3: The Bulb Worshippers Love Almost Everyone
## July 15, 2019
### From gopher.somnolescent.net, the Gopherhole of the weird lightbulb people
Can you believe it's been two-and-a-half months since the last recap? We
don't rush a lot around here, but we do keep busy. Site overhauls, writing,
drawing...and possibly a new member?

## Caby's sketchbook
First up, Capy (or perhaps Caby, but that's just *silly*) has totally
overhauled her site. Her last one was a placeholder dating all the way back
to the site being bought in December, so an overhaul was much overdue. Out
with the CGA and pixels and what have you--in their place are scribbly,
adorable capybaras and guinea pigs, a proper art gallery with a...throwback
vibe :3c, and at long last, content in the Cavy Castle! It's a really comfy
look; borb called it an "animated sketchbook", and I think that's apt. Very
worth exploring.

## Augmented snake
Caby's not the only Somnolian with a fresh site though--just earlier this
evening, former KitchenAid spokesman dotcomboom came back with an updated
take on his old Neocities site, now featuring photos! One of the perks of
DreamHost is that we can run proper scripts on our sites, both client and
server-side, with database access even if needed. Photo galleries, guestbooks
(yes, proper cgi-bin guestbooks, not some link to another site, gosh), blog
software, even WordPress, MediaWiki, and Joomla are all fair game for the
Somnolians now. Ah, the perks of being out on our own.

## mari content go go go
I've been toiling on a really massive story project that'll be hidden away
in my site (thanks `.htaccess`, another perk of real web hosting uwu), but
lots of little stuff's been added while it's still a work-in-progress. Old
modding tools, *Guitar Hero* customs, HyperCard clip art, Minesweeper
sperging, the works. Oh, and most importantly to me, more Pennyverse writing!
These character shorts were an idea I stole from a scriptwriting class I
stopped going to, so I guess it helped me after all~

## Blog happenings

Activity hasn't stopped here on the blog either (admittedly because I write
a lot of entries, umu). In case you missed any of them, here's a poignant
bit out of each:

- How a Fusion Drive Ate Our Gopher by mariteaux (April 30): "So if there's
anything in this swirling, messed up world I can trust, I guess it's Apple's
internal hard drives."
- The Web is a Shitty App Platform by mariteaux (May 09): "We've managed to
build an internet where the same shitty service is being delivered through
Chrome, not-Chrome, embedded Chrome, and Chrome on Android, and takes
advantage of none of their strengths as a result."
- Cavy Wars by Caby (May 19): "I've heard that adding a male guinea pig to
your herd can stop females from trying to be so dominant, so perhaps that's
a solution. Though Bergerac is a total nutcase and has tried to intimidate
humans before, so we'll see."
- On Purpose by mariteaux (June 03): "Above all, characters need a reason to
exist."
- Gopher is not the Web by dotcomboom (June 27): "There is still an infinite
amount of potential for this protocol, much of which hasn't been quite
realized yet."
- Somnoville by mariteaux (July 04): "mon's been hard at work on a big dome
with animals grazing up at the top, Caby's the server's resident flower girl,
and borb...built a granite dick."
- Cammy vs. the PhotoCam by mariteaux (July 13): "And please, think of your
pal Cammy when you list stuff on eBay--if you didn't actually test the
fucking thing, do tell me."

Things keep going as they do around here, no matter what. We're still
expecting another site overhaul, and mon's still working on his first one
quietly in the background. Art Fight's also kept some of the Somnolians busy,
but I can't really include art in the recap...maybe. There's also been
whispers of a certain new Somnolian joining us, a rather friendly Neocities
lurker who reached out to us recently, asking about dedicated hosting. Who
exactly that is, you'll have to wait for...

*(On a personal aside, in a few days, Caby and I will have been a thing for
six entire months. It's not quite an anniversary, but it's still the first
time we've had anything like each other, so it's special to us. She's helped
me out with a lot of personal issues and things I went through the past few
years, and she's been growing just as fast. I'm glad she's stuck around in
the group and I still have her. Lovely, talented girl.)*

Okay, that's it for the recap. Be back in two-and-a-half months!
