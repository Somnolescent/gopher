# Recap #1: Start Again
## March 15, 2019
### From gopher.somnolescent.net, the Gopherhole of the weird lightbulb people
A Somnolian joins the fray with a new site, and we're visited by a gopher
snake. How about a quick recap?

---

Three months out from the launch of the site and we still stand tall.

I've long wanted to write some updates letting those of you visiting know
what different members of the collective have been up to, and thankfully, we
now have some news: carrot, aka Barbara, aka our hyperactive alien produce
friend, has her site up! She's still pretty new to this site stuff, but it's
a really good start. Can't wait for her to build on it some.

Still waiting on Taywen and mon's sites, the former being an IRL writer
friend of mine and the latter being a coder and fellow chunky Mac enthusiast.
Despite the shakeups, our collective is still strong at eight people total,
and everyone's pretty busy this time of year. Group's just about back up to
speed.

Beyond that, dotcomboomâ€˜s been hard at work, not just with a BeOS-styled site
redesign, but also with a Gopher library for Python called Pituophis (clever,
that). We're looking to transfer Somnolescent's own server off Bucktooth and
onto Pituophis in the future, now that it's got all the features we use.

Finally, capy and I have been floating between projects. I'm writing a lot
more lately, both for my own personal fantasy world Calelira and for one of
our group's shared worlds, the Pennyverse. A lot of the action happens down
my Gopherhole, so if you like reading, chase that down.

I also should have a new album coming out within the next month or so under
my aphrodisiac name. Details to come.
