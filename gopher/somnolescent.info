Somnolescent is an art collective and group of close friends formed in the
end days of 2018 (though the name and idea have existed for much longer, from
almost the dawn of the decade). The Somnolians are tinkerers and loners,
weaving together ancient technology, unpopular thought, textures, fixations
and fascinations, storytelling, and the drive to keep moving forward. It's no
mere curiosity for us; Somnolians use the past as a way to get to the future.

This is the new, much-improved version of the Somnolescent Gopher server.
Instead of individual Gopherholes for each Somnolian, all menus are dedicated
to a specific project of one of our members. Some of this content, especially
the outtakes, are exclusive to Gopherspace. We hope you enjoy your visit;
there's much to see here.
