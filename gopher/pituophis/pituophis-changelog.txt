Pituophis version history:

1.1 (May 16, 2020):
This release contains breaking API changes- take caution when updating.
   * Selector class has been renamed to Item
   * Globbing is fixed on Windows
   * Single Items can now be sent by custom/alt handlers like strings and
   lists of Items can
   * URL parsing has been rewritten to adhere to RFC 4266 (including %09 for
   search queries)
   * URLs returned by Request().url() do not include :70 if the port is 70
   (as this is the default port for all Gopher sites); they also do not add
   "/" to the beginning of selector strings (for Gopher servers that don't
   necessarily use this filesystem scheme)
   * error.host is no longer used by default in the path/selector field of
   new Items (as it could be misinterpreted when looking at menu source code
   client-side); the field is now blank by default
   * Plenty of refactoring, tidying and other good things
   * TreeGopher demo added and readme updates

1.0 (June 12, 2019):
Default handler:
   * Globs no longer breaking out of public directory
   * Markdown files have item type 0 (text) in directory listings instead of
   the default type 9 (binary)

Client:
   * parse_url() checks if path ends with a '/' and sets type to 1

0.99 (April 20, 2019):
This is actually just 0.98 but with a fixed setup.py.

0.98 (April 19, 2019):
Server:
   * An advertised port can be set (for handler usage) for when you're
   rerouting the "advertised" port (like 70) to the actual server port
   
Default handler:
   * Glob sorting (and in turn, sorting of directory listings) now works
   correctly, and directories are on top of files
   * Checks if a file with an unknown MIME type is actually a director
   before giving it that type, otherwise gives it the 9 (generic binary)
   type; applies to ? pseudotype and globbing

0.97 (March 17, 2019):
Server:
   * Listens on any hostname, not just 127.0.0.1. Fixes outside connections,
   which were previously broken.


0.96 (March 13, 2019):
   * When getting the Request object of a Selector object, the query will be
   set if that's in the selector's field
   * urllib is now used for parsing URLs
   * IPv6 support (wrap IPv6 address in square brackets)

0.95 (March 9, 2019):
Server:
   * Fix when serving information selectors from a gophermap
   * Type guessing, Gopher globbing and gophertags for feature parity with
   Bucktooth
   * Globbing is used for directory listings

0.94 (February 18, 2019):
Default handler:
   * URL redirect page has a title
   
Client:
   * Extra tabs are now discarded, which means menus with Gopher+ selectors
   don't absolutely explode (a Good Thingâ„¢)

0.93 (February 14, 2019):
Default handler:
   * Directory listings now display file size and last modified date
   * Directory listings now display directory items without crashing

0.92 (February 13, 2019):
Default handler:
   * Relative links fixed and converted into real paths
   * Directories without trailing slash now work correctly
   * "URL:" requests are now redirected

0.91 (February 12, 2019):
Default handler:
   * Quick fix to display the port in parsed gophermaps on TLS connections as
   5-digit numbers (i.e. making port 105 display as "10105") as this seems to
   be the accepted S/Gopher way of doing it

0.90 (February 12, 2019):
The first release!
