Pituophis is a full Gopher library written in Python 3. Powerful and flexible,
Pituophis can request and parse data over the Gopher protocol or serve it out
if desired. It supports Gopher over TLS, arbitrary ports, gophermap parsing,
Bucktooth-like globbing, type guessing, and gophertags, and requires minimal
dependencies. Somnolescent's Gopher server is powered by Pituophis.

To demonstrate its client capabilities, TreeGopher is packed in with recent
versions of Pituophis. TreeGopher also acts as a proof of concept for dcb's
ideal Gopher client, featuring such things as a tree view and inline display
of text and images.
