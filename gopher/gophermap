==== SOMNOLESCENT: SUBTERRANEAN =======================================
0About (for non-compliant clients)	somnolgopher.info

Somnolescent is a collective of artists, musicians, writers, coders,
and the anxious who chase creation as its own end. This is one of our
outposts, deep underground in the tunnels of endless Gopherspace.

We maintain this server as a low-overhead way for retro machines,
mobile devices, and the curious to browse our hoards. If you'd like
something a bit more visual, do check us out at our websites:

hSomnolescent on the Web	URL:http://somnolescent.net/

As of January 2024, this place has recently been redesigned to be more
appealing to browse and less arbitrarily structured. We hope to keep
things much more up-to-date this time around, though again, use the
above link if you want to be on the bleeding edge of Somnol content.

(Still being worked on! Expect more on this menu soon!)
